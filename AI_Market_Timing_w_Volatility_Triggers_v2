#    High Volatility Regime (VIX > 20): volatility is more likely to remain elevated

#    Low Volatility Regime (VIX < 20): volatility is more likely to remain low



#    Low volatility regime (VIX < 20 or declining): 100% S&P 500 Index

#    High volatility regime (VIX > 20 and increasing): 100% Bloomberg Barclays US Intermediate Treasury Index
